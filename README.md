# Nullable Types
A library of nullable types for Visual Basic 6 applications.

Inspired by the [Nullable\<T\> Structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b3h38hb0%28v=vs.100%29.aspx) added to the .NET Framework in version 2.0, this library provides a complete set of nullable types for Visual Basic 6 applications to complement the [built-in data types](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa263420%28v=vs.60%29.aspx).

The use of a nullable type can be helpful when reading values from database queries which may return a NULL value. It allows for the type safety of, say a Long, to be used without having to resort to the use of Variant to account for the possible NULL value.

TODO: Add example for above scenario.
